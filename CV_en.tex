\section*{Appointments held}
\noindent
\years{2018-}\textbf{External lecturer}, IT-University of Copenhagen, Denmark\\
At ITU I have planned and taught an introduction seminar for master's students
on programming, programming tools and computational literacy with outstanding reviews. \\[0.5cm]
\years{2016-}\textbf{Adjunct professor}, Copenhagen Business Academy,
Denmark\\
As an adjunct professor I developed materials and lectured in
a range of topics, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, business
analytics and design and operations of large systems.
I received high praise for my ability to internalise and communicate academic
material, as well as my level of dedication and pedagogical skills.\\[0.5cm]
\years{2016-2019}\textbf{Chief Technology Officer}, Mobilized Construction, Denmark, Kenya\\
At Mobilized Construction I designed and implemented infrastructure required for
their globally distributed infrastructure.
My role also involved managerial responsibilities for our development teams in 
Wales and Kenya, and I personally supervised student
projects at the master's level from the University of Southern
California and the University of Wales.\\[0.5cm]
\years{2014-2016}\textbf{Software engineer}, CERN, Switzerland\\
At CERN I was driving the development and maintenance of
a monitoring toolchain for the accelerator control system complex.
My contract was extended to work on a testbed for the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) accelerator, with an emphasis on real-time critical
systems architecture in Java. \\[0.5cm]
\years{2013}\textbf{Instructor}, Mobile and Distributed Systems, IT-University of
Copenhagen, Denmark\\
I lectured on principles and research on mobile and distributed
systems and participated in the development of new teaching
materials. \\[0.5cm]
