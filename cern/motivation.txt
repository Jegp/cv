Motivated to participate and contribute
I am motivated to be a part of one of the most advanced research facilities in the world. A danish software engineer from CERN, Sten Jensen, visited my university in 2013 to raise awareness for job offerings at the institute, and urged us to apply for the programme. I find the work done at CERN to be equally important for the global community as it is exciting, and Sten Jensen's presentation made me realise that the technical student position is a unique opportunity to combine my personal and professional interests.

Building on my professional experience
At CERN I hope to get a chance to work with and further explore advanced software techniques. During my education and work-life I have been exposed to a number of technologies and engineering techniques. Currently I am employed in a university based group of researcher studying democratic technologies and trust. My position has given me the opportunity to study a wide range of systems grounded in research. I hope I can use and develop this professional experience at CERN.

Participating in an international context
I am excited about the opportunity to work in the international context of CERN and participate in the building of the interdisciplinary environment. Recently I studied cross-border management at l'École d'Ingénieurs en Informatique, where I gained experience in working in and with cuturally diverse settings, as well as improved my language skills in French. As a former student of political science I am also highly interested in culture and international collaboration.
